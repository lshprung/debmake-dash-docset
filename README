Here is a script and a Makefile for generating a debmake docset for Dash. It is built from documentation provided by the [debmake-doc](https://salsa.debian.org/debian/debmake-doc) package and provides guides useful for the creation of deb packages. The script is loosely based on benzado's script for GNU Make https://github.com/benzado/gnu-make-dash-docset.

- debmake: https://salsa.debian.org/debian/debmake
- Dash: https://kapeli.com/dash

Requirements:

- any POSIX-compliant shell
- curl
- make
- po4a
- sqlite3

To generate a docset, simply execute `make` from the same directory as this README file. The version installed on the system will be packaged appropriately. The default locale is English (en). Alternative locales can be specified by executing `make LOCALE=$(locale)` (where $(locale) is the short form, i.e. "en"). The list of supported locales is listed below:

- German           (de)
- English          (en)
- Japanese         (jp)
- Russian          (ru)
- Chinese (China)  (zh-cn)
- Chinese (Taiwan) (zh-tw)
